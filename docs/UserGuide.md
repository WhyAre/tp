TAskbook is a **desktop app for managing students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast,
TAskbook can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TUTORIAL_NAME]...` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cs2103`,
  `t/cs2103 t/cs2040s` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters
  (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document,
  be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Saving the data

TAskbook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

## Editing the data file

TAskbook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid,
TAskbook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAskbook to behave in unexpected ways
(e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range).
Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAskbook home folder.

## Known issues

1. **Multi-screen display**:  
   When moving the application between screens, the GUI may open off-screen.  
   _Fix_: Delete `preferences.json` before restarting.

2. **Help Window**:  
   Minimized help windows don't restore properly when reopening help.  
   _Fix_: Manually restore the window.

3. **Data Synchronization (v1.5)**:

   - Add the ability to edit tutorial by using Tutorial tags (`t/`)
   - Student descriptions are session-only (lost on app restart)

4. **Data Export (v1.5)**:

   - Doesn't include:
     - Submission histories
     - Attendance records
   - Limited to current session data

5. **Interface Issues**:

   - Window resizing required for long assignment names (>5 chars)
   - Tutorial indexes change after filtering/sorting

6. **System Limitations**:
   - No bulk operations across multiple tutorials
   - Orphaned submissions may exist after deletions

## Troubleshooting

1. **Data not saving**: Ensure you have write permissions in the installation directory.
2. **Invalid command errors**: Check for exact parameter formats and case sensitivity.
3. **Missing features**: Some advanced features are planned for v2.0.
